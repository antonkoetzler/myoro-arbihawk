# /fix-syntax

Look through the entire codebase, running any analyze commands to find any types or either errors or warnings for any language. Fix all warnings, making sure to clean up anything residual things that is left such as packages that aren't being used, dead code, dead files, etc. Try to avoid ignoring errors (i.e. commenting out errors, using comments to ignore warnings, etc).
