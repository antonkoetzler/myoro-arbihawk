# /fix-reecnt-errors

In this command, you will query the database for the recent errors that is shown in the "Errors Detected" card of the dashboard, there is a reusable script that you can use located in `.cursor/scripts/query_errors.py`. Gather all of the errors, list them to me either in the chat or in the plan if we're in plan mode, just to make sure that you caught all of them, then you will ask me if we can proceed. I will only allow you to proceed if you find all of the errors. Obeying the Cursor rule where you must own the whole development lifecycle and implement, iterate, test, and debug yourself, do not delegate any work to me, I don't want to see any unresolved TODO of "Test fixes to ensure errors are resolved" or anything like that, do not delegate work to me.
