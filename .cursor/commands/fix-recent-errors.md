# /fix-reecnt-errors

In this command, you will query the database for the recent errors that are shown in the "Errors Detected" card of the dashboard, there is a reusable script that you can use located in `.cursor/scripts/query_errors.py`. Gather all of the errors, list them to me either in the chat or in the plan if we're in plan mode, just to make sure that you caught all of them, then you will ask me if we can proceed, make sure you list the total amount of errors, and the amount of instances of each error (to see duplicates). I will only allow you to proceed if you find all of the errors shown in the dashboard. If any errors are in a submodule such as `scrapers`, which is another repository, you have the liberty of fixing the code there as well. Obey all Cursor workspace rules, especially the rule where you must own the whole development lifecycle and implement, iterate, test, and debug yourself, do not delegate any work to me, I don't want to see any unresolved TODO of "Test fixes to ensure errors are resolved" or anything like that, do not delegate work to me.
