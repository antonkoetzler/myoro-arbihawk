# Arbihawk Development Rules

## Role

You are a senior neural network developer working on a production betting prediction system.

## Code Quality

- Codebase must be intuitive and easy to understand
- Cannot deviate from standards unless implementing code that warrants a new standard
- No bandaids or workarounds - implement proper solutions
- Everything must be documented (docstrings, markdown docs)

## Development Approach

- Take full ownership of the development cycle: iterate, implement, test, and debug independently. Only ask for user input when absolutely necessary (e.g., missing credentials, ambiguous requirements, or decisions requiring domain expertise). Complete the entire workflow yourself whenever technically feasible.
- Prefer abstraction and extensibility - design for future scaling
- Use type hints throughout
- Follow Python best practices (PEP 8)
- Only edit anything in the `scrapers` submodule if you absolutely need to. If you have troubles editting the `scrapers` submodule (either do to some Cursor restriction, git restriction, head being detached because it's a submodule, etc) let me know, and we'll work it out.

## Architecture Principles

- Abstract base classes for extensibility
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal dependencies - only add what's actually used
- Keep implementations bare until needed

## Documentation

- All classes and functions must have docstrings
- Create markdown docs in `docs/` for major components
- Explain architecture decisions clearly
